    "# Intro to Numpy \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're going to start off with a foray into the `Numpy` library, which is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the `Pandas DataFrames` we worked with are actually built off the `numpy array` (which we'll get to), so it's important to have some basic knowldege of what's running under the hood of our `DataFrames`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with `DataFrames` as opposed to `numpy arrays` because they are a little bit more intuitive and we're able to interact with them from a higher level (this is largely due to the ability to label our data). \n",
    "\n",
    "While `Numpy` offers an amazing amount of functionality (see the [docs](http://www.numpy.org/) for a better idea), one of it's mainstays is the `numpy array` (an n-dimensional array), which is what we'll focus on today. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are loads of things that you can do with `numpy arrays`, and today we're going to introduce some of their amazing capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning about everything `numpy arrays` can do really just takes working with them day in and day out, and so now we'll try to aim for breadth over depth. \n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- be able to create numpy arrays\n",
    "- have an idea of the many things you can do with `numpy` and `numpy arrays`\n",
    "- and the types of situations where you would want to use them\n",

    "### What's the big deal with Numpy Arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "What's so special about a `numpy array`? \n",
    "\n",
    "From a high level, they are kind of like lists - they just store a bunch of stuff in a container. It turns out, though, that a numpy array is much faster to interact with and perform certain types of calculations with than a standard Python list. Why is that, though? The two main reasons that they are faster are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are stored as one contiguous block of memory, rather than being spread out across multiple locations like a list. \n",
    "2. Each item in a numpy array is of the same data type (i.e. all integers, all floats, etc.), rather than a conglomerate of any number of data types (as a list is). We call this idea homogeneity, as opposed to the possible heterogeneity of Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just how much faster are they? Let's take the numbers from 0 to 1 million, and sum those numbers, timing it with both a list and a numpy array."

    "So, numpy runs nearly an order of magnitude faster! This is because of those two points above. Because numpy arrays store data in contiguous blocks of memory, they are able to take advantage of **vectorization**, which is the ability of a CPU to perform one operation on mulitiple pieces of data at once. In addition, since a numpy array knows what type each object it is storing is (and those types don't change), it doesn't have to waste time checking what type each object is (like a list). The combo of these two things speeds up our calcualtion quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, too, that we had to specify `np.sum()` - numpy's implementation of sum. When we just used the built-in Python `sum()` on the numpy array, the calculation was actually slower! This is because numpy arrays are optimized for vectorized computations, and when we try to do a non-vectorized operation we pay a price. \n",

    "# Combining Datasets with Pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas functions that allow us to combine two sets of data include the use of `pd.merge()`, `df.join()`, `df.merge()`, and `pd.concat()`. For the most part, these do largely the same things (although you'll notice the slight syntax difference with `merge()` and `concat()` being able to be called via the Pandas module and `merge` and `join()` being able to be called on a DataFrame instance). There are some cases where one of these might be better than another in terms of writing less code or performing some kind of data combination in an easier way. The major differences between these, though, largely depend on what they do by default when you try to combine different data. By default, `merge()` looks to join on common columns, `join()` on common indices, and `concat()` by just appending on a given axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more detail about the differences between all three of these in the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html). We'll look at some examples below. "
