    "There are numerous libraries available in Python for creating visualizations. Often times, we will probably be using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and/or [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for anything that is general purpose, and then other libraries if we need something more specialized ([Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for dashboards, for example). All of these libraries allow us to build great looking visualizations that can be used in a production setting. If we want something quick and dirty to visualize our data very easily, there is also some plotting functionality built into Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html), we can see that the plotting available with Pandas will be called via the `plot()` method on a DataFrame object. From there, we'll pass in a bunch of potential arguments to the `plot()` method to specify exactly how to build the plot. The most important of those arguments is the `kind` keyword argument, which tells the `plot()` method what kind of visualization we would like (bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, etc.). Most of the time we'll be doing your visualization in Matplotlib or Seaborn, but here is a little taste of what Pandas can do so that you know it's there. \n",

    "A dataset on the [quality of red wines](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) is used for this purpose. You already got to know this data set in the last notebook. Now we will try to get an even better feel for the dataset with the help of some plots. At the end of the notebook, there are some tasks where you should  create some plots with pandas. \n"
